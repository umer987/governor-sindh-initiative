//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

var guestList = ["umer", "ahad", "anas", "zain", "bilal"];
for (var i = 0; i < guestList.length; i++) {
    console.log("Dear ".concat(guestList[i], ", you are cordially invited to dinner. It would be an honor to have you join us."));
}

//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.


// Create a list of favorite fruits
var favoriteFruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Strawberry", "Mango"];
// Print each fruit in the list
console.log("List of Favorite Fruits:");
for (var i = 0; i < favoriteFruits.length; i++) {
    console.log(favoriteFruits[i]);
}
